Basics of Elliptic Curve Cryptography Implemented on Python
Author: Jules Oppenheim

The program uses an ElGamal encryption and a Digital Signature Algorithm, DSA, to encrypt and decrypt a message securely and quickly. The encryption can use different coordinate sets for faster run-times (e.g. Affine, Projective, Jacobian).
