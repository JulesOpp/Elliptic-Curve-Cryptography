Basics of Elliptic Curve Cryptography Implemented on Python
Author: Jules Oppenheim

The program uses an ElGamal encryption and a Digital Signature Algorithm, DSA, to encrypt and decrypt a message securely and quickly. The encryption can use different coordinate sets for faster run-times (e.g. Affine, Projective, Jacobian).

The message to be encrypted is read from a text file and the encryption is written to another text file.
The encryption is read from the text file and written to a third text file.
