Aesop's "The Ants and the Grasshopper" THE ANTS were spending a fine winter's day drying grain collected in the summertime.  A Grasshopper, perishing with famine, passed by and earnestly begged for a little food.  The Ants inquired of him, "Why did you not treasure up food during the summer?'  He replied, "I had not leisure enough.  I passed the days in
singing." They then said in derision: "If you were foolish enough to sing all the summer, you must dance supperless to bed in the winter." It is thrifty to prepare today for the wants of tomorrow
